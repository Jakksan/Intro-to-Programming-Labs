open the image file and show the grayscale image

Name: get_color_temp()
Description: takes the rgb value from the grayscale and prints out the temperature of the input pixel
Parameters: x (the x coordinate of the pixel), y (the y coordinate of the pixel)
Returns: None

accesses the color map file and reads it to a list of values
    open file for reading
    quits if error in accessing file
read the first line
for each line in the list
    break up each line into color variable lists

convert the image into a numpy array, then to a standard list

run the program for 100 timesteps and print each step
    for each pixel, check it's neighbors and average the values
                each of each pixel's neighbors
                accounts for boundaries of the box
                takes the average
                This is an edge cell.

takes each pixel value and converts it to an rgb value based on the color map
turns the list back into a numpy array
creates an image from the numpy array
show final image
