save the start time to a variable

do the following loop using values between 4 and 8 (value is i):

    create the dots_under_curve give it a value of 0
    create a variable for the total number of dots (total_dots) set it to 10^i

    do the following loop for each dot total_dots times:
        set a random x value and save it
        set a random y value and save it

        if the square root of the sum of the x value squared and the y value squared < 1 do the following:
            set the dots_under_curve variable to dots_under_curve + 1

    print the number of darts thrown
    print the Approximation of pi
    print the computation time
